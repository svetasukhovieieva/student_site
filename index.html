                        The Breville Bambino Plus has taken the #1 spot in my review of the best home coffee machines in Australia because it crushes the competition from a features perspective.
                        It is the smallest of home coffee machines that I shortlisted for review, but it packs a surprising punch.
                        The machine’s tiny footprint will appeal to people with limited bench space. That being said, it’s a full-featured machine – and will allow you to play around with pre-infusion and shot volume.

                        A PID is included and is almost unheard of at this price point. Nice work, Breville. Consider my eyebrow raised – for all the right reasons.
                        If you don’t have the time or the desire to learn how to froth milk, the Bambino Plus has an automatic frothing function. Just stick the milk jug in and press play. It will do everything and cut steam off before the milk gets too hot.

                        Even though the machine doesn’t have two boilers, the Bambino Plus switches between brewing and frothing modes very quickly – and surprisingly, more quickly than the more expensive Breville Barista Express.
                        The Bambino does not have a built-in grinder, which is why it`s relatively inexpensive.
